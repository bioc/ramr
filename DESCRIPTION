Description: ramr is an R package for detection of low-frequency aberrant
    methylation events in large data sets obtained by methylation profiling
    using array or high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. In addition, package
    provides functions to visualize found aberrantly methylated regions (AMRs),
    to generate sets of all possible regions to be used as reference sets for
    enrichment analysis, and to generate biologically relevant test data sets
    for performance evaluation of AMR/DMR search algorithms.
