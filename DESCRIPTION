Description: ramr is an R package for detection of epimutations (i.e.,
  infrequent aberrant DNA methylation events)
  in large data sets obtained by methylation profiling using array or
  high-throughput methylation sequencing. In addition, package
  provides functions to visualize found aberrantly methylated regions (AMRs),
  to generate sets of all possible regions to be used as reference sets for
  enrichment analysis, and to generate biologically relevant test data sets
  for performance evaluation of AMR/DMR search algorithms.
