\arguments{
\item{data.ranges}{A `GRanges` object with genomic locations and
corresponding beta values included as metadata.}

\item{data.samples}{A character vector with sample names (a subset of
metadata column names). If `NULL` (the default), then all samples (metadata
columns) are included in the analysis.}

\item{ramr.method}{A character scalar: when ramr.method is "IQR" (the
default), the filtering based on interquantile range is used (`iqr.cutoff`
value is then used as a threshold). When "beta", "wbeta" or "beinf" -
filtering based on fitting non-weighted (`EnvStats::ebeta`), weighted
(`ExtDist::eBeta`) or zero-and-one inflated (`gamlss.dist::BEINF`)
beta distributions, respectively, is used, and `pval.cutoff` or `qval.cutoff`
(if not `NULL`) is used as a threshold. For "wbeta", weights directly
correlate with bin contents (number of values per bin) and inversly - with
the distances from the median value, thus narrowing the estimated
distribution and emphasizing outliers.}

\item{iqr.cutoff}{A single integer >= 1. Methylation beta values differing
from the median value by more than `iqr.cutoff` interquartile ranges are
considered to be significant (the default: 5).}

\item{pval.cutoff}{A numeric scalar (the default: 5e-2). Bonferroni
correction of `pval.cutoff` by the length of the `data.samples` object is
used to calculate `qval.cutoff` if the latter is `NULL`.}

\item{qval.cutoff}{A numeric scalar. Used as a threshold for filtering based
on fitting non-weighted or weighted beta distributions: all p-values lower
than `qval.cutoff` are considered to be significant. If `NULL` (the default),
it is calculated using `pval.cutoff`}

\item{merge.window}{A positive integer. All significant (survived the
filtering stage) `data.ranges` genomic locations within this distance will be
merged to create AMRs (the default: 300).}

\item{min.cpgs}{A single integer >= 1. All AMRs containing less than
`min.cpgs` significant genomic locations are filtered out (the default: 7).}

\item{min.width}{A single integer >= 1 (the default). Only AMRs with the
width of at least `min.width` are returned.}

\item{exclude.range}{A numeric vector of length two. If not `NULL` (the
default), all `data.ranges` genomic locations with their median methylation
beta value within the `exclude.range` interval are filtered out.}

\item{cores}{A single integer >= 1. Number of processes for parallel
computation (the default: all but one cores). Results of parallel processing
are fully reproducible when the same seed is used (thanks to doRNG).}

\item{verbose}{boolean to report progress and timings (default: TRUE).}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to `EnvStats::ebeta` or
`ExtDist::eBeta` functions.}
}
\value{
The output is a `GRanges` object that contains all the aberrantly
methylated regions (AMRs) for all `data.samples` samples in `data.ranges`
object. The following metadata columns may be present:
\itemize{
  \item `revmap` -- integer list of significant CpGs (`data.ranges` genomic
  locations) that are included in this AMR region
  \item `ncpg` -- number of significant CpGs within this AMR region
  \item `sample` -- contains an identifier of a sample to which
  corresponding AMR belongs
  \item `dbeta` -- average deviation of beta values for significant CpGs from
  their corresponding median values
  \item `pval` -- geometric mean of p-values for significant CpGs
  \item `xiqr` -- average IQR-normalised deviation of beta values for
  significant CpGs from their corresponding median values
}
}
\description{
`getAMR` returns a `GRanges` object with all the aberrantly methylated
regions (AMRs) for all samples in a data set.
}
\details{
In the provided data set, `getAMR` compares methylation beta values of each
sample with other samples to identify rare long-range methylation
aberrations (epimutations).
For `ramr.method=="IQR"`: for every genomic location (CpG) in
`data.ranges` the IQR-normalized deviation from the median value is
calculated, and all CpGs with such normalized deviation not smaller than the
`iqr.cutoff` are retained. For
`ramr.method %in% c("beta", "wbeta", "beinf")`: parameters of beta
distribution are estimated by means of `EnvStats::ebeta` (beta distribution),
`ExtDist::eBeta` (weighted beta destribution), or `gamlss.dist::BEINF` (zero
and one inflated beta distribution) functions, respectively. These
parameters are then used to calculate the probability values, followed by the
filtering when all CpGs with p-values not greater than `qval.cutoff` are
retained. Another filtering is then performed to exclude all CpGs within
`exclude.range`. Next, the retained (significant) CpGs are merged within
the window of `merge.window`, and final filtering is applied to AMR genomic
ranges (by `min.cpgs` and `min.width`).
