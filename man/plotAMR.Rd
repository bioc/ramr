\title{Plot aberrantly methylated regions}
\usage{
plotAMR(
  data.ranges,
  data.samples = NULL,
  amr.ranges,
  highlight = NULL,
  title = NULL,
  window = 300
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.ranges}{A `GRanges` object with genomic locations and
corresponding beta values included as metadata.}

\item{data.samples}{A character vector with sample names (a subset of
metadata column names) to be included in the plot. If `NULL` (the default),
then all samples (metadata columns) are included.}

\item{amr.ranges}{An output of `getAMR` - a `GRanges` object that contain
aberrantly methylated regions (AMRs).}

\item{highlight}{An optional list of samples to highlight. If NULL (the
default), will contain sample IDs from the `sample` metadata column of
`amr.ranges` object.}

\item{title}{An optional title for the plot. If NULL (the default), plot
title is set to a genomic location of particular AMR.}

\item{window}{An optional integer constant to expand genomic ranges of the
`amr.ranges` object (the default: 300).}
}
\value{
The output is a list of `ggplot` objects.
}
\description{
`plotAMR` uses `ggplot2` to visualize aberrantly methylated regions (AMRs)
at particular genomic locations.
}
\details{
For every non-overlapping genomic location from `amr.ranges` object,
`plotAMR` plots and outputs a line graph of methylation beta values taken
from `data.ranges` for all samples from `data.samples`. Samples bearing
significantly different methylation profiles ('sample' column of
`amr.ranges` object) are highlighted.
}

  data(ramr)
  plotAMR(ramr.data, ramr.samples, ramr.tp.unique[1])
  library(gridExtra)
  do.call("grid.arrange",
          c(plotAMR(ramr.data, ramr.samples, ramr.tp.nonunique), ncol=2))
